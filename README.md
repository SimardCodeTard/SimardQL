# SimardQL
Trying to make my own simple database in C ! Built following Connor Stack's tutorial https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial

## Setup
### Install CMake

#### MacOS
`brew install cmake`
#### Linux
`sudo apt install cmake`

### Initialize Cmake
Run the following command in your terminal :

`mkdir -p ./build && cd /build && cmake ..`

### Environment variables
The file **public.env** should already exist and contain the current version of the database, for any sensible information, create a file named **private.env** and define them in it


## Building & running
execute the run.sh script

`./run.sh`
